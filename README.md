# Rick & Morty App ‚ú®

This project demonstrates **Modern App Architecture** best practices in a **Multi-Module** Android application using **MVI** architecture pattern. This app is made entirely in Kotlin and consumes pure Kotlin libraries to manage application data **(SqlDelight, Ktor)** and UI **(Jetpack Compose)**. Dependency Injection is managed via **Koin**.

## Dynamic Colors - Android 12+
Dynamic Color enables users to personalize their devices to align tonally with the color scheme of their personal wallpaper or through a selected color in the wallpaper picker. You can read more about Dynamic Colors [here](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/views/theming/dynamic-colors).

## üìê Architecture Overview

The app architecture has three layers: a [data layer](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/guide/data-layer), a [domain layer](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/guide/domain-layer) and a [UI layer](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/guide/ui-layer). The architecture follows a reactive programming model with [unidirectional data flow](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/guide/ui-layer#udf). With the data layer at the bottom, the key concepts are:
*   Higher layers react to changes in lower layers.
*   Events flow down.
*   Data flows up.

The data flow is achieved using streams, implemented using [Kotlin Flows](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/flow).

### UI Layer
The UI layer is the pipeline that converts application data changes to a form that the UI can present and then displays it. The state is managed using a [Unidirectional Data Flow (UDF)](https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture/ui-layer#udf) which aligns with the  **MVI (Model View Intent)** architecture pattern's **event-based** nature.

### Data Layer
While the UI layer contains UI-related state and UI logic, the data layer contains application data and business logic. The business logic is what gives value to your app‚Äîit's made of real-world business rules that determine how application data must be created, stored, and changed. The data layer is implemented as an offline-first source of app data and business logic. It is the [source of truth](https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture#single-source-of-truth) for all data in the app.

### Domain Layer
The domain layer is an optional layer that sits between the UI layer and the data layer. The domain layer is responsible for encapsulating complex business logic, or simple business logic that is reused by multiple ViewModels. This layer contains Usecases/Interactors which interact with data sources inside Data Layer.

**Rick & Morty App** is an [offline-first app](https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture/data-layer/offline-first#:~:text=An%20offline%2Dfirst%20app%20is%20an%20app%20that%20is%20able%20to%20perform%20all%2C%20or%20a%20critical%20subset%20of%20its%20core%20functionality%20without%20access%20to%20the%20internet.%20That%20is%2C%20it%20can%20perform%20some%20or%20all%20of%20its%20business%20logic%20offline.) and the app flow works as:
1. Characters are fetched from [Rick & Morty API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/) using Ktor-client for Android.
2. Characters are then stored in a SqlDelight Database. Our database inside Data layer is our single source of truth.
3. The stored characters in cache are then requested by the Usecase in our domain layer.
4. Characters from the cache are then exposed to the UI layer where they can be accessed as observable data streams i.e. Kotlin Flows.

This app has two screens:
1. **Characters List Screen**
2. **Character Details Screen**

## üì¶ Modularization Overview
We have following modules in our project. Among these modules, we have **Android Application** module, **Android Library** modules & pure **Java/Kotlin Library** modules. I have preferred using pure Kotlin libraries in domain & data layers as they can easily be reused in Kotlin Multiplatform projects. Therefore, **SqlDelight** is preferred over **Room** & **Ktor client** is used instead of **Retrofit**.
